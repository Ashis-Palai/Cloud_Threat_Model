                  "type": "Spoofing",
                  "description": "In a cloud-native environment where the browser is the user's entry point to a RAG chatbot application, spoofing attacks pose significant risks. Adversaries may use malicious clients, headless browsers, or automation frameworks such as Selenium or Puppeteer to spoof legitimate users. These bots can be programmed to imitate human interactions with the browser, bypassing weak client-side validation mechanisms and interacting with the ECS-hosted Streamlit UI. Attackers often combine spoofing with stolen session tokens, credential stuffing, or social engineering to hijack identities and perform unauthorized actions—such as querying sensitive datasets or overloading backend inference APIs.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, adversaries can harvest session tokens using browser-based XSS payloads or phishing attacks, then reuse these tokens in fake browser sessions. They may also forge headers (e.g., User-Agent, Authorization, Referer) to trick the system into believing the requests originate from a legitimate source. In more advanced scenarios, bots mimic legitimate user behavior, including mouse movements and click delays, making detection harder. This opens the attack surface for prompt injection, data scraping, or resource abuse, particularly dangerous in public-facing generative AI systems.\n\nFrom a cloud TTP standpoint, attackers may leverage initial access techniques such as T1078 (Valid Accounts) with valid credentials obtained via phishing or T1204.002 (User Execution via malicious links) to deliver scripts that compromise browser sessions. In the AWS context, a cloud-focused adversary may target exposed CloudFront endpoints or attempt T1589.002 (Gathering victim identity info) via unprotected UI metadata or debug logs, then abuse those identities from bot infrastructures. For DoS-style spoofing, bots can flood ECS endpoints with thousands of fake interactions, exhausting backend model invocation quotas.",
                  "mitigation": "To mitigate browser spoofing threats in cloud environments, organizations should implement a multi-layered control strategy using AWS-native tools and open-source capabilities. At the edge layer, AWS WAF with AWS Bot Control should be configured to detect and block automated non-human traffic. Bot Control profiles behavior and fingerprint patterns to identify headless browsers or scripted clients attempting to access CloudFront-distributed endpoints. Custom WAF rules can throttle or block high-frequency fake browser sessions based on known automation signatures or anomalies in request headers.\n\nOn the identity and session side, integrating Amazon Cognito with WebAuthn/FIDO2-based MFA helps bind sessions to verified devices, ensuring that even if credentials or tokens are stolen, session hijacking is mitigated. Cognito can also enforce advanced risk-based authentication, while AWS Lambda@Edge scripts running at CloudFront can inject logic to validate user behavior and flag anomalous usage early.\n\nFor more adaptive detection, solutions like AWS GuardDuty and Amazon Detective can track suspicious behavior over time. These services correlate patterns of identity misuse, like token reuse across geographies or sudden bursts of traffic from uncommon IP ranges. In parallel, open-source tools like Fail2Ban, ModSecurity (with OWASP CRS), and CrowdSec can be used in custom ALB-based Fargate setups to add additional detection layers at the container ingress level.\n\nBrowser communications should enforce HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security), delivered via CloudFront response headers, ensuring that the client only communicates via HTTPS. This reduces the risk of session hijacking via downgrade attacks or MITM proxies, especially on insecure networks.\n\nGRC alignment is essential here. These mitigations align with the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) CCM IAM-02 and IAM-05 for identity enforcement, CIS Control 6.2 and 6.3 for MFA and session management, and NIST CSF PR.AC-1/PR.AC-7 which require rigorous access control and automated system protections. Further, ISO/IEC 27001 A.13.1.1 emphasizes the need for secure communication and spoof-resistant interfaces, ensuring that only authenticated, validated users are allowed to initiate transactions via the browser.",

                  "severity": "Medium",
                  "type": "Repudiation",
                  "description": "In a cloud-based RAG chatbot scenario, where the UI is accessed via browser, repudiation becomes a serious concern when the system lacks reliable mechanisms to authenticate, trace, and attribute user actions. In this case, users interact with the application to generate prompts, submit queries, or retrieve personalized context—all of which are functional actions with potential legal or business consequences. Without cryptographically signed requests, session-bound identity correlation, or secure and immutable logging, a user may later deny having performed an action, such as sending a malicious prompt, initiating a high-cost API call, or querying sensitive data.\n\nRepudiation can also occur when browser session correlation is weak—such as when session tokens are not bound to the user's device or IP, or when logs don't contain forensic-grade metadata like user-agent strings, timestamps, geo-IP, and session context. Furthermore, if adversaries gain temporary control of a session (e.g., via session fixation or token reuse), they may impersonate legitimate users to trigger unauthorized interactions, which later become unattributable due to lack of integrity in the audit trail.\n\nCloud-specific adversary behaviors include session abuse via token replay (aligned with MITRE ATT&CK T1550.002) and action laundering through federated logins without proper audit context. From a real-world perspective, users (or malicious insiders) could exploit this gap by injecting toxic prompts, executing unauthorized RAG workflows, or launching excessive inference jobs, and later disavow responsibility, claiming browser misuse or session takeover.",
                  "mitigation": "The repudiation threat in cloud-based browser interactions can be effectively mitigated by implementing tamper-evident audit trails, strong identity assurance, and robust session attribution using both AWS-native and open-source technologies.\n\nAt the identity layer, leveraging Amazon Cognito with OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect helps establish strong federated identity. Each interaction should include the user’s identity token (ID token) which is cryptographically signed and validated by backend services—ensuring that all user-generated requests carry proof of origin. Additionally, Cognito allows tracking of user devices and session metadata, enabling stronger binding between browser sessions and user identity.\n\nFor forensic-grade logging, integrating AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch, and AWS AppConfig ensures every significant user action is logged with contextual information such as request headers, IP address, timestamps, and session identifiers. These logs should be shipped to AWS S3 buckets with Object Lock enabled (WORM – write-once-read-many) to guarantee log immutability. To detect abnormal sequences of events, AWS Detective can be employed to correlate session timelines across services. This supports incident response and repudiation dispute investigations.\n\nFrom a frontend security perspective, using tools like OpenTelemetry or Sentry on the browser UI allows client-side instrumentation and trace correlation with backend logs. This helps build a complete \"breadcrumb trail\" of user actions across the request-response lifecycle. \n\nIn environments using open-source infrastructure, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Fluent Bit with Loki + Grafana can be used to construct and visualize user session flows. Additionally, Sigstore or The Update Framework (TUF) can be explored for request signing in high-integrity applications, where user-originated requests (especially to LLM pipelines) are signed and verified before processing.\n\nThese controls align with several GRC standards. NIST CSF PR.PT-1 and PR.PT-3 demand audit trails and secure logs. CSA CCM LOG-01, LOG-02 require logging of access and activity, while ISO/IEC 27001 A.12.4.1 and A.12.4.2 cover event logging and protection. CIS Control 8.7 and 8.8 recommend centralized logging and protection of audit logs. Ensuring logs are cryptographically verifiable and attributable directly supports non-repudiation requirements under enterprise GRC programs.",

In this setup, spoofed requests pose a significant threat. Attackers may attempt to impersonate legitimate users, internal services, or trusted AWS components to deceive the UI application and gain unauthorized access to protected resources.\n\nOne vector involves attackers crafting requests that impersonate authenticated users by forging identity headers (e.g., Authorization, X-Amz-*, X-User-Id) or manipulating session tokens—particularly if the UI layer relies on client-supplied metadata without robust token verification. If identity checks are only shallow or handled on the frontend, a forged request could be treated as trusted and gain backend access.\n\nMore advanced threats include spoofing internal service calls, especially if ECS services are behind a load balancer and service-to-service traffic is trusted by default. For example, if the Streamlit app receives REST or gRPC calls from other internal services and those are identified only by IPs or hostnames, an attacker could spoof those requests—especially if internal DNS, service discovery, or container-to-container isolation is weak.\n\nIn containerized environments, spoofing may extend to IAM roles. If Fargate tasks assume IAM roles via Task Execution Role or IRSA, and those roles are not scoped correctly, attackers may deploy malicious containers that spoof identity or invoke metadata services (http://169.254.170.2) to escalate privileges and gain access to secrets or credentials used by the UI application.\n\nRelevant adversary TTPs include:\n\nMITRE T1078 (Valid Accounts) and T1001.003 (Protocol Impersonation).\n\nCloud-specific TTPs like abusing misconfigured service mesh trust, forging X-Amz headers, or accessing ECS metadata service to spoof AWS identity.\n\nAbuse of container-to-container L2 reachability (if VPC subnet isolation is misconfigured), allowing an attacker to impersonate other microservices or trusted monitoring agents.",

Use Amazon Cognito or AWS IAM Identity Center to enforce token-based authentication, and implement backend JWT token verification using libraries like pyjwt in the Streamlit application itself. This ensures that identity tokens are validated independently at the ECS layer before invoking downstream services.\n\nFor internal service-to-service authentication, implement mutual TLS (mTLS) between ECS services using App Mesh, Envoy sidecars, or Istio on EKS. mTLS ensures both client and server are authenticated and cryptographically bound to their identity, eliminating risks from spoofed internal calls.\n\nTo protect against spoofed AWS identities or metadata abuse, configure the Fargate task role with minimal privileges using IAM policy conditions, such as aws:SourceVpc, aws:SourceAccount, and aws:ViaService. Disable access to metadata endpoints unless explicitly required.

                  "description": "The ECS Fargate-hosted Streamlit UI serves as a user-facing application that acts as the orchestration layer in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. As such, it receives, processes, and potentially displays sensitive data—such as authentication tokens, user inputs, personally identifiable information (PII), or responses generated by large language models (LLMs). If proper security controls are not in place, this component becomes a high-risk surface for accidental or unauthorized disclosure of data to users, attackers, or other unintended consumers.\n\nInformation disclosure risks can arise from several vectors. First, the Streamlit UI may inadvertently expose internal service error traces, stack traces, or detailed backend exceptions—especially if the app is deployed in debug or verbose mode. These errors can leak API credentials, environment variables, or insights into the app’s structure, which can be leveraged for further exploitation. Additionally, since Streamlit renders UI elements dynamically from Python, poorly controlled output rendering may display the contents of secrets, memory-resident data, or unescaped outputs from the LLM or other services—potentially leading to prompt leaks, system metadata exposure, or LLM responses containing hallucinated or private data.\n\nA particularly dangerous scenario is when the ECS service logs or temporarily caches responses that include sensitive inference results or user-uploaded files. If these are not properly protected in memory or temporary storage, they could be accessed by co-tenant containers (in rare edge cases), or leaked via misconfigured application state sharing. If the Streamlit app supports uploading user data (like documents, PDFs, etc.), and uses local temp directories without access control, adversaries might exploit that to access other users’ content via path traversal or leftover artifacts.\n\nAdditionally, cloud-specific issues may arise if the Fargate task assumes a broad IAM role that allows access to sensitive S3 buckets or secrets, and those are accidentally queried or surfaced in the UI. Similarly, if environment variables containing API keys, database URIs, or Bedrock credentials are not isolated, they may become exposed via error messages, diagnostic UIs, or even interactive widgets if debugging features are left enabled.\n\nTTPs aligned here include:\n\nMITRE ATT&CK T1552 (Unsecured Credentials) and T1081 (Credential Dumping).\nT1592.004 (Data Leak from Error Messages).\nCloud-specific variants, such as environment variable leakage in container output, IAM role over-permissioning, and temporary data sharing across container instances or via misconfigured ALBs.",

Given that the Streamlit UI is the user interaction layer—and is often trusted to orchestrate downstream workflows like data retrieval, LLM inference, or context storage—an EoP attack here can cascade to compromise the entire RAG pipeline.\n\nOne of the most common cloud-specific vectors is IAM role misuse. If the ECS task role assigned to the Streamlit UI is over-privileged, or lacks Condition constraints, then any code within the container—legitimate or injected—can perform actions such as querying Secrets Manager, invoking Bedrock endpoints, reading from S3 buckets, or modifying DynamoDB records. Attackers who gain execution within the container (via RCE, SSRF, or unsafe eval/pickle usage) can escalate their control by simply querying the task metadata endpoint (169.254.170.2), extracting temporary AWS credentials, and using them to perform high-impact operations.\n\nAnother EoP vector involves privilege gaps in the Streamlit application logic. If the app fails to enforce role-based access control (RBAC) or user-scoped authorization, then users may invoke administrative functions, query other users’ session data, or execute elevated actions like retraining embeddings or modifying backend configurations. For example, if LLM prompt pipelines are shared across users, and the Streamlit logic does not sanitize request context based on user identity, one user may craft a request that piggybacks another user’s access level.\n\nEven container-level privilege escalation is possible. Although ECS Fargate uses a managed runtime, if the container image is misconfigured to run as root, an attacker exploiting a deserialization vulnerability, shell injection, or unsafe subprocess call (e.g., os.system, subprocess.Popen) might gain privileged access inside the container, and then pivot through API calls or LLM abuse.\n\nRelevant TTPs include:\n\nMITRE ATT&CK T1068 (Exploitation for Privilege Escalation) and T1550 (Use of Alternate Authentication Material).\nT1528 (Abuse of Cloud IAM Roles)—especially in AWS ECS with poorly scoped task roles.\nT1609 + T1078.004 – Container admin privileges and cloud user credential theft.",

While Fargate provides scalable compute, the application remains vulnerable to application-layer Denial of Service (DoS) if malicious users exploit the system’s compute, memory, or downstream dependency calls.\n\nA prominent attack vector is the submission of specially crafted inputs designed to consume disproportionate backend resources. For instance, an adversary could automate repeated LLM prompts that trigger complex vector searches, multiple API calls to Bedrock, or embed documents for chunking—each of which is compute and I/O-intensive. Without rate-limiting or intelligent throttling, the Streamlit container could be overwhelmed, leading to excessive CPU usage, out-of-memory (OOM) errors, or container restarts. If auto-scaling is enabled, this could further lead to scale storming, rapidly increasing cost and quota usage.\n\nAnother DoS risk arises from concurrent session overload, where an attacker opens multiple browser sessions or WebSocket connections to keep the UI application persistently busy. Streamlit, though lightweight, holds session state in memory during a user’s interaction. Inadequate session limits can cause memory leakage or contention, resulting in degraded performance or unresponsive UI.\n\nMoreover, the Fargate task could be a target of logic bombs—user inputs that seem benign but trigger recursive LLM chains, deep document traversals, or complex embeddings.

For more advanced setups, rate-limit or isolate LLM-triggering endpoints behind an API Gateway with usage plans and burst caps.\n\nGRC alignment:\n\nNIST CSF PR.IP-10 and DE.CM-1 – Incident response and continuous monitoring for anomalies.\nCIS Control 13.1, 13.3 – Use of anti-DoS techniques at multiple layers.\nCSA CCM DSI-02, IVS-06 – Denial of service mitigation and workload isolation.\nISO/IEC 27001 A.12.1.3 – Protection against DoS and availability loss.",

If this data is transmitted over unencrypted or improperly secured channels, it is susceptible to interception, surveillance, or leakage—either passively or actively—by unauthorized entities.\n\nA common attack scenario involves a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacker observing traffic over public or compromised networks. If the connection is not strictly encrypted with strong TLS configurations, an attacker can sniff plaintext credentials, prompt content, session cookies, or even access tokens. Cloud-specific risks may emerge if ALB endpoints allow HTTP fallback or if TLS certificates are misconfigured, expired, or issued from untrusted authorities. Another subtle but frequent issue is misconfigured headers—such as CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies allowing sensitive data to be fetched from unauthorized origins, potentially exposing user session or inference context.\n\nAdditionally, browser plugins or malicious extensions may read sensitive request/response data, especially if sensitive tokens are stored in cookies without proper HttpOnly or Secure attributes. While this is partly a browser concern, the application backend shares responsibility if it misplaces session data in URLs, localStorage, or insecure response payloads.\n\nCloud-focused attackers may target improperly secured CloudFront distributions or exploit AWS ALB misconfigurations, for example, where the ALB accepts connections over HTTP or lacks proper redirect enforcement to HTTPS. Furthermore, improper cache behavior at CloudFront could result in one user’s prompt or output being cached and served to another—leading to unintentional data exposure.\n\nTTP-wise, this threat maps to:\nMITRE ATT&CK T1040 (Network Sniffing) for passive eavesdropping.\nT1557.002 (MitM: ARP Spoofing) if network-level access is present.\n",
                  "mitigation": "To mitigate this threat, the system must enforce strong, end-to-end encryption, fine-grained data exposure controls, and network visibility tools to monitor potential leakage.\n\nFirst, ensure TLS 1.2 or higher is enforced throughout the transmission path using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), which can issue and manage public certificates for ALB or CloudFront endpoints. Use AWS Shield Standard in conjunction with CloudFront to protect against TLS downgrade or interception attacks. Disable HTTP entirely and enforce 301 redirects at the ALB or CloudFront distribution to ensure traffic is always encrypted.\n\nImplement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) in CloudFront response headers using Lambda@Edge or at the ECS UI layer, ensuring that modern browsers do not attempt HTTP fallback even during first connection. Additionally, validate that CORS policies are tightly scoped—allowing requests only from explicitly known domains and preventing * wildcards on sensitive routes.\n\nSession tokens should always be stored and transmitted using Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=strict cookies. Avoid embedding tokens in URLs or localStorage. For form data and responses containing sensitive data, the UI should use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent exfiltration via script injection or cross-site leaks.\n\nTo detect and monitor disclosure risks, use AWS GuardDuty to analyze VPC flow logs and detect anomalous traffic to external IPs. Amazon Macie can be applied to logs or payload storage (e.g., if using S3 as intermediate storage) to automatically classify and alert on sensitive data like PII, access keys, or credentials. On the open-source side, integrate ZAP proxy (Zed Attack Proxy) in pre-production pipelines to simulate passive disclosure risks, or deploy Wireshark in test environments to verify that no unencrypted data leaves the browser.\n\nGRC alignment includes:\n\nNIST CSF PR.DS-2 and PR.DS-5 – Data in transit and data exposure controls.\nCIS Control 13.3 – Encrypt data in transit.\nISO/IEC 27001 A.13.2.3 – Ensuring integrity and confidentiality during transmission.\nCSA CCM DSI-02, IVS-03 – Transmission protection and system integrity validation.",

If this data flow is not rate-limited, authenticated, or validated, it becomes a potential target for DoS attacks—both volumetric and logical.\n\nA common vector here is application-layer DoS, where attackers flood the UI with a high volume of HTTP(S) requests, mimicking legitimate browser interactions. This can overwhelm the ECS-hosted Streamlit UI or consume underlying compute resources provisioned through AWS Fargate, leading to resource exhaustion, latency, or downtime. In RAG systems, even simple user queries can cascade into expensive downstream LLM processing or vector store searches, meaning a modest volume of requests can have disproportionate backend impact.\n\nFrom the attacker’s perspective, such a DoS campaign can be launched using tools like slowloris, h2c Smuggling, headless browsers (Selenium, Puppeteer), or scripted bots to maintain persistent, idle, or malformed connections that tie up Fargate tasks. These attacks are more dangerous when your UI accepts unauthenticated requests or lacks intelligent throttling.\n\nCloud-specific vectors include:\n\nExploiting AWS ALB listener rules that forward all traffic without inspection.\n\nTriggering autoscaling storms by creating traffic spikes that cause unnecessary task scale-outs—eventually leading to AWS service quota breaches or unexpected costs.\nLeveraging proxy bypass methods like misconfigured CloudFront behaviors that allow direct UI access, skipping WAF controls.\nRelevant TTPs include:\n\nMITRE ATT&CK T1499 (Endpoint DoS) via HTTP request flood.\nT1464 (DoS via application abuse) through excessive legitimate-looking traffic.\nCloud-specific TTPs: AWS-focused attackers may bypass protections using IP rotation via residential proxy networks or cloud-based load generators (abuse of free-tier services).",

Add AWS CloudWatch alarms to flag anomaly-based usage spikes, which may indicate early stages of an application-layer DoS.\n\nFrom an open-source angle, deploying ModSecurity (with OWASP CRS) or NGINX Rate Limiting Modules in front of the UI can provide cost-effective pre-filtering.

This data flow typically includes user queries, prompts, context variables, authentication tokens, and session metadata. If these communications are not cryptographically protected end-to-end, attackers can manipulate them during transit.\n\nA realistic attack vector involves a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack where the adversary is positioned between the user and the application—this can occur in poorly secured public Wi-Fi environments, misconfigured reverse proxies, or compromised browser extensions. In such cases, attackers may inject malicious payloads (e.g., prompt injection, malformed input), modify existing requests (e.g., elevate access scope), or even suppress valid data. Another form of tampering includes client-side script injection, where an attacker compromises local browser execution (via XSS or compromised JavaScript dependencies), and then alters outbound requests to the UI component.\n\nIn the cloud context, adversaries might attempt TLS stripping (downgrading HTTPS to HTTP) if HSTS is not enforced or exploit misconfigurations in CloudFront distributions that don't properly forward only secure traffic. They might also exploit vulnerable client libraries or misconfigured API Gateway integrations that don’t validate request integrity.\n\nTTP alignment includes MITRE ATT&CK T1557 (Man-in-the-Middle) and T1036 (Masquerading). In AWS-specific threat scenarios, an attacker might intercept traffic to an unencrypted ALB or exploit weak certificate validation when the browser communicates with a custom domain without verified TLS enforcement.",
                  "mitigation": "To mitigate tampering threats in this data flow, cloud-native encryption and secure communications enforcement are essential.\n\nFirst, enforce end-to-end encryption using TLS 1.2 or higher. This should be managed via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for the ALB or CloudFront endpoint, using publicly trusted and auto-renewed certificates. All communications between the browser and UI must be terminated at a secure ALB with HTTPS-only listeners, and TLS policies should be hardened using AWS’s “recommended” security policy.\n\nTo prevent TLS stripping and downgrade attacks, HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) must be configured on the CloudFront distribution or within the ECS response headers using Lambda@Edge or ALB header manipulation. HSTS ensures that the browser enforces HTTPS and doesn’t allow insecure fallback.\n\nTo detect and prevent manipulated payloads at the edge, deploy AWS WAF with AWS Managed Rules (AMRs) and optionally custom rules to validate input patterns. For open-source deployments, integrating ModSecurity with the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) on a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx or Envoy) adds further protection by analyzing and rejecting tampered HTTP requests.\n\nYou can also implement request signing mechanisms using tools like AWS API Gateway with Lambda authorizers or SigV4 signed requests, ensuring requests haven’t been altered in transit and originate from trusted clients.\n\nFor continuous detection, Amazon GuardDuty can be used to monitor for unusual traffic patterns and potential MitM indicators, such as DNS spoofing or credential exfiltration attempts. Pair this with AWS CloudTrail and VPC Flow Logs to correlate and analyze data flow anomalies.\n\nFrom a GRC standpoint, this mitigation strategy maps to:\n\nNIST CSF PR.DS-2 – Data in transit is protected.\nCIS Control 13.3 – Secure encrypted communications.\nISO/IEC 27001 A.10.1.1 – Network controls for protecting data.\nCSA CCM DSI-02 and TVM-01 – Transmission integrity and vulnerability monitoring.",
