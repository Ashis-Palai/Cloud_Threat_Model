# üõ°Ô∏è Threat Modeling with PASTA: AWS Bedrock RAG Chatbot

This document presents a comprehensive **PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)** threat modeling analysis for a cloud-native **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** architecture using **AWS Bedrock, ECS Fargate, Streamlit, DynamoDB, OpenSearch, Titan Embeddings, and Amazon S3**.

The objective is to assess threats systematically using the 7-stage PASTA methodology, allowing us to:
- Align technical and business impact in threat identification,
- Integrate architectural understanding (e.g., LLM workflows, user identity, document enrichment),
- Map simulated attack surfaces to controls across CSP-native services (e.g., IAM, Bedrock, VPC, Gateway, etc.).

PASTA enables not just vulnerability identification, but a **risk-oriented narrative** rooted in real-world attacker perspectives and **cloud-specific TTPs**. It‚Äôs especially valuable for systems like this where:
- Sensitive data flows between user input, documents, embeddings, and AI inference.
- There are complex multi-boundary interactions (VPC ‚Üî AWS-managed services).
- Orchestrators (Lambda) hold central control logic that needs careful review.

Each of the upcoming sections will dive into a stage of the PASTA model with relevance to our architecture.
### üó∫Ô∏è Architecture Overview

The architectural diagram below illustrates the high-level structure of the AWS Bedrock RAG chatbot system, including boundaries, components, and data flows across Lambda, Bedrock (Claude 3), Titan, S3, OpenSearch, and user-facing services:

## üîç PASTA Stage 1: Define the Objectives

This stage defines the **business**, **security**, and **risk** foundation for the RAG chatbot system.

### 1. Business Objectives

The primary goal of this application is to provide an interactive **LLM-powered chatbot** that allows users to query across structured and unstructured enterprise knowledge using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** framework.  
The system leverages:
- **AWS Bedrock (Claude 3)** for LLM inference,
- **Titan Embeddings + OpenSearch** for semantic search,
- **Amazon S3** as the document source, and
- **DynamoDB** for session memory/state.

Key functional outcomes:
- Deliver fast, context-aware chatbot responses.
- Seamlessly incorporate new document knowledge without retraining.
- Enable enterprise-wide secure access to AI-powered search/assist features.

### 2. Security and Compliance Requirements

Given the nature of document ingestion and LLM interaction, the system must ensure:
- **Data confidentiality** of user input and chat history (via encryption at rest and in transit),
- **IAM-based least privilege** access across Lambda, Bedrock, and storage layers,
- **Protection against prompt injection and session hijacking**,
- **Audit trails** for all sensitive operations (e.g., document embedding, LLM invocation),
- **Regulatory readiness**: GDPR/ISO 27001-style access control and retention policies,
- Compliance with **Cloud Security Alliance (CSA CCM)**, **NIST CSF**, and **AWS Well-Architected Framework** security pillars.

### 3. Business Impact (BIA)

If the system is compromised or unavailable:
- **Data integrity loss** in embeddings or RAG sources may degrade response quality.
- **LLM spoofing or leakage** may cause reputational or compliance damage.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)** on document ingestion pipeline (S3 ‚Üí Titan ‚Üí Vector DB) may render chatbot non-functional.
- Impaired or manipulated chatbot responses can lead to **loss of user trust**, especially if misinformation or unauthorized access occurs.

Impact severity: **High**, especially for document-sensitive organizations (e.g., legal, healthcare, or internal ops).

### 4. Risk Profile

The system operates under a **moderate-to-high threat surface**, including:
- External user interactions,
- API gateway exposures,
- LLM model behavior unpredictability,
- Vector DB poisoning or enumeration,
- Weak isolation in serverless contexts.

Mitigation posture includes:
- Tight IAM policies,
- Use of AWS-native threat detection (GuardDuty, CloudTrail),
- Data validation and schema enforcement before embedding,
- Embedding fingerprinting or duplicate detection.

This risk profile sets the tone for deeper analysis in the next stages of the PASTA process.

---

## üß≠ PASTA Stage 2: Define the Technical Scope

This stage identifies the architectural boundaries, actors, data sources/sinks, and all technical dependencies of the RAG-based chatbot system.

### 2.0 Technical Scope Overview

The RAG chatbot is a distributed, cloud-native application deployed across customer-controlled and AWS-managed services. It integrates serverless orchestration, real-time embeddings, and LLM inference across multiple trust zones.

---

### 2.1 Identify Application Boundaries, Actors, Data Sources & Sinks

**Trust Boundaries:**
- **Internet**: Entry point for users accessing the chatbot via Streamlit.
- **AWS Customer VPC**: Hosts ECS, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3.
- **AWS Managed Services**: Includes Bedrock (Claude 3), OpenSearch, and Titan Embeddings.

**Actors:**
- External: End-users interacting via UI.
- Internal: Lambda (orchestrator), Titan (embedding engine), Bedrock (LLM inference).

**Data Sources:**
- User inputs (chat queries),
- S3 documents (knowledge ingestion),
- DynamoDB (chat memory).

**Data Sinks:**
- OpenSearch (embedding vector storage),
- Bedrock (consumes RAG-enriched prompts),
- Streamlit UI (delivers final response).

---

### 2.2 Application Dependencies from Network Environment

- **API Gateway** acts as the control plane for routing requests to Lambda.
- **VPC endpoints / PrivateLink** are recommended for internal communication with AWS managed services to avoid traffic over the public internet.
- **TLS/HTTPS** is enforced for all inter-service communication.
- Network access is segmented by security groups and NACLs to reduce lateral movement.

---

### 2.3 Application Dependencies from Servers & Infrastructure

- **ECS Fargate**: Stateless container runtime that handles incoming UI traffic, performs pre-processing, and relays requests to the Lambda orchestrator.
- **Lambda**: Central orchestrator managing session state, context fetching, embedding pipelines, and LLM interactions.
- **DynamoDB**: Provides chat session persistence across user interactions.
- **Amazon S3**: Stores static documents to be processed and embedded for semantic context.
- **Amazon OpenSearch (Vector DB)**: Stores embeddings with metadata, enabling semantic search retrieval based on Titan vector matches.
- **AWS Bedrock (Claude 3)**: Executes LLM prompts and returns chat-like responses in context.

All services are deployed through **Infrastructure as Code** using tools like **AWS CDK** or **Terraform**, enabling repeatable, policy-compliant provisioning.

---

### 2.4 Application Dependencies from Software Components

- **Streamlit (Python)**: UI layer where users input queries and receive final responses.
- **FastAPI / Flask**: Lightweight backend server deployed on ECS for routing, validation, and session token handling.
- **LangChain or custom prompt orchestration**: Manages chaining logic for RAG ‚Äî embedding ‚Üí search ‚Üí prompt creation ‚Üí LLM call.
- **SentenceTransformers or Titan Integration Layer**: Used to convert documents or user queries into embeddings before storing in OpenSearch.
- **OpenSearch Python Client**: Enables querying the vector DB from Lambda using vector similarity.
- **Requests / HTTPX**: For making HTTPS calls from Lambda or ECS to Bedrock, Titan, or internal services.
- **JSON Schema Validators**: Used to validate the structure of prompt templates, documents, and embeddings to prevent malformed data or injection attacks.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline to automate deployment of Lambda, ECS tasks, and IaC modules. Static analysis, policy scans, and OPA gatekeeping may be included.

---

This completes the technical scope definition for the system. Next, we move into identifying threat agents and potential attack vectors in Stage 3.

## üß© PASTA Stage 3: Decompose the Application

This stage focuses on breaking down the RAG chatbot application into use cases, data flows, and security-functional boundaries to enable detailed threat enumeration in later stages.

---

### 3.1 Use Case Enumeration

The primary use cases for the AWS Bedrock RAG chatbot include:

- **Chat Interaction**: Users input natural language questions via the Streamlit UI.
- **Query Handling**: ECS backend forwards input to the Lambda orchestrator.
- **Context Enrichment**:
  - Lambda fetches session history from DynamoDB.
  - It queries OpenSearch for relevant embedded content.
  - If required, it generates embeddings via Titan from documents stored in S3.
- **Prompt Construction & LLM Execution**: Enriched prompt is sent to Claude 3 via AWS Bedrock; response returned.
- **Response Delivery**: Lambda updates session history and sends final output to Streamlit via ECS.

---

### 3.2 Data Flow Diagrams

To visualize the system components, communication paths, and trust boundaries, we refer to both manual and automated DFDs:

---

### 3.3 Security Functional Analysis and Trust Boundaries

**Defined Trust Boundaries:**

- **Internet Boundary**: Initial untrusted zone where users initiate interaction.
- **Customer VPC Boundary**: Secure zone where ECS, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3 (private) operate under strict IAM controls.
- **AWS Managed Services Boundary**: Operated by AWS; includes Bedrock, Titan Embeddings, and OpenSearch (vector DB).

**Security Functional Observations:**

- Lambda operates across multiple trust boundaries and holds central access to sensitive systems. It requires strict runtime integrity, IAM role separation, and telemetry.
- Data entering the system passes through multiple stages: ECS > API Gateway > Lambda > vector enrichment > LLM. Each stage is a potential threat insertion point if not validated or encrypted.
- Documents stored in S3 act as upstream knowledge sources and must be immutable and verified before embedding.
- Embedding and search infrastructure (Titan + OpenSearch) is AWS-managed but interacts bidirectionally with Lambda, requiring encryption in-transit, fine-grained policy control, and embedding tamper detection.
- All ingress and egress paths are TLS-enforced. Logging and audit trails must span across boundaries to support full forensic visibility.

---

The decomposition phase provides the architectural clarity needed to map specific threats, attacker motivations, and technical weaknesses in subsequent PASTA stages.

---
## üîç PASTA Stage 4: Analyze the Threats

This stage focuses on evaluating the threat landscape by blending system knowledge with threat intelligence, attacker modeling, and likelihood estimation.

---

### üîπ Objectives

- Analyze architectural and component-level threat scenarios.
- Correlate threat intelligence from external sources (e.g., MITRE, OWASP, CSA).
- Enrich internal threat libraries with LLM- and cloud-native attack patterns.
- Map threat agents to high-value assets and trust zones.
- Assign probabilistic scores to threats based on risk impact and exploitability.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Threat Scenario: Token Replay and API Abuse via Gateway

**Threat Title:**  
`Token Replay and API Abuse via Gateway`

**Description:**  
An adversary captures a valid API token or session credential (e.g., via credential stuffing, insecure transport, or endpoint compromise) and reuses it to interact with the API Gateway. This can lead to unauthorized Lambda invocations, chat session manipulation, or prompt flooding. The serverless and stateless nature of the architecture increases detection difficulty, especially if API throttling is not tightly configured or tokens lack short expiration and binding.

**Potential Impact:**  
- Denial of Service (Lambda resource exhaustion)  
- Unauthorized writes or edits in DynamoDB  
- Excessive use of embedding/LLM resources leading to billing spikes  
- Sensitive data leakage through session impersonation  
- Breach of tenant isolation in multi-user scenarios

**Affected Components:**  
- API Gateway  
- Lambda (orchestration function)  
- DynamoDB (session state)  
- AWS Bedrock (Claude 3 inference)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Threat Scenario: LLM Response Spoofing in Transit

**Threat Title:**  
`LLM Response Spoofing in Transit`

**Description:**  
An adversary positioned in a compromised or misconfigured network (e.g., via exposed internal endpoints, SSRF, or VPC peering flaws) could intercept or spoof responses from AWS Bedrock‚Äôs Claude 3 LLM. Since the inference runs outside the customer VPC and responses flow through Lambda and API Gateway, the integrity of the LLM‚Äôs response relies on secure transmission. If attackers modify payloads in transit, they could deliver malicious, misleading, or impersonated content while impersonating the trusted LLM source.

**Potential Impact:**  
- Delivery of malicious or misleading content  
- Impersonation of Claude 3 model outputs  
- User deception and phishing via falsified responses  
- Legal, compliance, or reputational impact from falsified AI decisions

**Affected Components:**  
- AWS Bedrock (Claude 3)  
- Lambda (LLM response handler)  
- API Gateway (response relay)  
- Streamlit UI (end-user response rendering)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Threat Scenario: Over-Permissioned Lambda Enabling Insecure Operations

**Threat Title:**  
`Over-permissioned Lambda Leading to Privilege Escalation`

**Description:**  
The Lambda function orchestrating the RAG workflow often has elevated IAM privileges across services such as DynamoDB, S3, Bedrock, OpenSearch, or Titan Embeddings. If the Lambda is compromised (e.g., via SSRF, injection, or logic flaws), an attacker could exploit these permissions to pivot laterally and perform unauthorized actions ‚Äî such as modifying session data, generating malicious embeddings, triggering LLM prompts, or exfiltrating sensitive documents. This is especially dangerous in environments lacking strong observability or monitoring (e.g., no GuardDuty, no CloudTrail analysis).

**Potential Impact:**  
- Full compromise of RAG pipeline (data + inference)  
- Prompt and context injection leading to LLM abuse  
- Unauthorized access or modification in DynamoDB and OpenSearch  
- Data leakage from S3 or misuse of Bedrock for arbitrary prompts  
- Abuse of LLM quotas, leading to financial and reputational damage

**Affected Components:**  
- Lambda (central orchestrator)  
- IAM roles attached to Lambda  
- Amazon S3, DynamoDB, OpenSearch  
- AWS Bedrock (LLM API)

---

## üß™ Stage 5: Vulnerability and Weakness Analysis

This stage focuses on identifying and correlating technical vulnerabilities and design weaknesses that could be exploited by the previously defined threats. It bridges the gap between threat scenarios and the actual risk posture by:

- Mapping known vulnerabilities to critical assets (data, components, infrastructure),
- Using established security taxonomies such as CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration),
- Providing the foundation for threat exploitation modeling using threat trees and use/abuse cases in the next sub-stages.

The goal is to translate architectural and threat insights into tangible risk drivers, categorized, quantified, and actionable for both engineering and governance teams.

### üîç 5.1 Correlating Vulnerabilities to Application Assets

Below is a mapping of key application assets (identified in Stage 3 decomposition) to their most relevant technical vulnerabilities based on known cloud-native application flaws, software weaknesses, and architectural posture.

#### üß† Lambda Function (Orchestrator) ‚Äì Vulnerability Mapping

The Lambda function serves as the central orchestrator for interacting with Amazon Bedrock, S3, OpenSearch, and other services. Below is a detailed vulnerability correlation for Lambda, derived from real-world findings, CVEs, and cloud misconfiguration patterns.

Without enforcement of BlockPublicAcls and BlockPublicPolicy, misconfigured buckets may allow unauthenticated access to sensitive data or enable data exfiltration through anonymous read/write operations. This exposure poses significant risks to the confidentiality and integrity of data assets.            |                                         |

Additionally, not using customer-managed KMS keys (CMKs) may limit key rotation and access control.

This misconfiguration allows any local user or process on the development machine or CI runner to access OpenSearch credentials, leading to lateral movement or privilege escalation. In shared or multi-user environments, this represents a critical exposure of authentication data, potentially allowing an attacker to modify or exfiltrate OpenSearch indexes and mappings. Proper file permission hygiene and secret management (e.g., using AWS Secrets Manager) are required to mitigate this.                            |

This can lead to unauthorized observation or tampering of RAG enrichment queries or retrieved data from the vector DB. In a secure Bedrock pipeline, this undermines the integrity and confidentiality of semantic search results. Enforcing modern TLS (1.2/1.3) and HTTPS-only policies is critical to secure data in transit.                                    |

In the context of a Bedrock RAG architecture, this can result in data leakage, unauthorized inference, or tampering with the vector store used by the chatbot. Proper isolation using IAM trust policies and domain access policies is essential to enforce tenant or boundary separation.                    |

Similarly, lacking encryption in transit can leak data during replication or cross-AZ communications. This poses significant risk to the integrity and confidentiality of the RAG pipeline supporting Amazon Bedrock. Enforcing both at-rest and in-transit encryption is essential for secure vector storage and transfer.          |

Without regular version reviews and upgrades, your Bedrock RAG setup may inherit vulnerabilities or miss out on stability and optimization improvements critical to semantic search performance. Maintain update hygiene through automated checks and staged upgrades.              |

This can lead to unauthorized queries, data tampering, or even index deletion. In RAG-based architectures, over-permissioned access can compromise knowledge integrity and expose sensitive semantic embeddings. Enforcing least privilege IAM policies with scoped actions and resources is essential.               |
| 8    | **CNAS-6: Insecure Network Policy** | Public endpoint exposed or internal traffic not restricted (ACLs, SGs),**CWE-1327: Binding to an Unrestricted IP Address**                                     | Runtime / Network    | **High**           | When OpenSearch domains are configured with public endpoints or lack network-level restrictions (e.g., misconfigured security groups or missing VPC access policies), they become vulnerable to vector scraping, brute-force similarity queries, or enumeration attacks. In a RAG-based architecture, this could lead to leakage of sensitive embeddings or knowledge base content through repeated queries. Enforcing private access endpoints, network ACLs, and strict security group rules is essential to reduce the OpenSearch exposure surface.                                 |

| 1 | **Encryption** | **DynamoDB At-Rest Encryption Disabled** ,**CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** | **Provision** | **High**   | If **at-rest encryption** is disabled for DynamoDB, sensitive data such as **user session tokens, chat history, PII, or user preferences** may be stored in plaintext on disk. This creates a risk of unauthorized access through backup compromise, snapshot leaks, or internal threat actors. In a Bedrock RAG-enhanced chatbot, where DynamoDB enriches LLM responses with user-specific context, **unencrypted data may expose behavioral insights, identity details, or usage patterns**, violating data protection policies. AWS KMS-based encryption (default or CMK) should always be enabled to mitigate this. |
| 2 | **Encryption** | **DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) Encryption Disabled** ,**CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** | **Provision / Runtime** | **Medium** | If **DAX cluster encryption at rest and in transit** is disabled, sensitive user data cached in memory ‚Äî such as **chat history, session tokens, or personalization context** ‚Äî is vulnerable to exposure. In a Bedrock-enhanced chatbot pipeline, attackers with lateral access to DAX nodes or network-level interception may **dump memory or sniff traffic**, leading to **session hijacking or data leakage**. Enabling DAX encryption helps protect transient session-level context stored in cache from runtime threats. |
| 3    | **IAM Misuse / Privilege**    | **DynamoDB IAM Authentication not enforced**, **CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function**                                                     | Provision            | **High**           | If access to DynamoDB is granted via permissive IAM roles (e.g., anonymous Lambda or wildcard principals), internal or external actors can invoke critical APIs like `PutItem`, `DeleteItem`, or `Scan`. Without strict IAM enforcement or SigV4-authenticated requests, unauthorized services may manipulate or extract table data. This risk is amplified when using Bedrock to retrieve contextual or indexed information from DynamoDB. Enforce strict IAM and identity-based policies with source scoping.                                 |                                                                                      |

In federated Bedrock or multi-tenant pipelines, this can cause unauthorized knowledge sharing, injection of poisoned data, or competitive intelligence leaks. Always restrict principal access and validate source constraints in trust and table policies.         |                                 
| 5     | **IAM Over-Permission**       | **CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource**, **CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment** ‚Äì Wildcard access to `dynamodb:*`           | Provision            | **High**           | Over-permissioned IAM roles (e.g., `dynamodb:*` or access to `*` tables) given to internal services or Lambdas can allow unauthorized item scans, deletions, or table modifications. In Bedrock workflows where context is stored or retrieved from DynamoDB, this can allow poisoning, leakage, or loss of prompt-associated records. Follow least-privilege practices and scope permissions to actions like `Query`, `PutItem`, or specific table ARNs.                                                                                       |

If **VPC endpoints** are used but lack proper restrictions (e.g., overly permissive NACLs, public subnet routing, or missing endpoint policies), internal access by untrusted services becomes possible. In sensitive architectures involving Bedrock, this can lead to unauthorized reads or noisy scans affecting cost and availability. Lock down endpoints using SGs, endpoint policies, and route controls.                                                                |

| ----- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | **Authentication & Authorization** | **API Gateway Access Control Not Enforced (REST & HTTP APIs)**  <br> **CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function** <br> **CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource** | **Runtime** | **Critical** | In both **REST APIs (v1)** and **HTTP APIs (v2)**, failure to properly configure **authentication (authN)** and **authorization (authZ)** controls in AWS API Gateway can lead to **critical exposure of backend services** like Lambda. <br><br> If no authN mechanism (such as IAM-based SigV4, Cognito JWT validation, or Lambda authorizers) is enabled, API Gateway permits **unauthenticated (anonymous) external clients** to invoke backend APIs. This exposes internal logic and services to the **entire internet**, enabling unauthorized users to interact with sensitive endpoints. <br> Even when authN is correctly implemented, **missing or misconfigured authorization policies** (e.g., IAM permissions, resource policies, or scope-based checks in Lambda authorizers) can allow **authenticated users to overreach** ‚Äî accessing or invoking APIs beyond their intended privilege level. <br><br>**REST APIs (v1):** If IAM or Lambda authorizers are not configured, any caller can hit critical endpoints without identity verification or privilege checks. <br>**HTTP APIs (v2):** Absence of **JWT-based authN** (via Cognito or external OIDC providers) leaves APIs publicly invocable, even when they handle sensitive data or trigger internal operations.<br><br>**Impact Analysis:**<br>  **Unauthenticated Attackers** (e.g., external recon bots, malicious internet users): Can invoke backend APIs directly, leading to data leakage, computation abuse, or unauthorized access to chatbot pipelines.<br>  **Authenticated but Overprivileged Users** (e.g., legitimate users/insiders or compromised sessions): Can perform unauthorized actions if fine-grained authZ is not enforced, such as invoking restricted routes or accessing internal orchestration layers.
| 2 | **Transport Security** | **Custom Domain TLS Version < 1.2** <br> **CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Crypto Algorithm** | Provision | **High**   | When API Gateway is exposed via a custom domain using TLS versions below 1.2 (e.g., TLS 1.0/1.1), it becomes susceptible to downgrade attacks, MITM, or protocol vulnerabilities like POODLE and BEAST. This allows adversaries on compromised networks (e.g., open Wi-Fi) to intercept or manipulate data in transit.   |
| 3 | **Transport Security** | **Use Secure TLS Policy Not Enforced** <br> **CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength/CWE-757: Selection of Less-Secure Algorithm During Negotiation ('Algorithm Downgrade')**         | Provision | **High**   | Even with TLS 1.2+, if a secure TLS policy is not enforced in API Gateway, the handshake can permit weak or deprecated cipher suites (e.g., RC4, 3DES). This creates an opportunity for attackers to exploit weak encryption during the handshake, potentially decrypting sensitive traffic between ECS and API Gateway. |
| 4 | **Access Control** | **Default Endpoint Not Disabled** <br> **CWE-1188: Initialization of a Resource with an Insecure Default**                    | Runtime | **High**     | If a custom domain for the API is secured (e.g., with Cognito or IP filtering), but the **default `execute-api` endpoint** is still enabled, attackers can bypass those protections by directly invoking the default URL. This silent backdoor exposes the same routes through an unprotected path, breaking defense-in-depth posture.             |
| 5 | **Traffic Protection** | **API Gateway WAF Not Enabled** <br> **CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure**          | Runtime | **High**   | Without AWS WAF attached to API Gateway, there are no protections against high-volume requests, brute-force attempts, or bot-based abuse targeting LLM endpoints. This exposes backend services (e.g., Lambda or Bedrock inference) to resource exhaustion or misuse.                                          |
| 6 | **Traffic Protection** | **API Gateway Client Certificate Not Required** <br> **CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation** | Runtime | **Medium** | API Gateway does not enforce mTLS (mutual TLS) by requiring client-side certificates during HTTPS communication. In internal-to-internal service communication (e.g., ECS ‚Üí API Gateway), this weakens service identity validation and makes man-in-the-middle attacks easier in misconfigured or shared VPCs. |
| 7  | **Input Validation** | **API Gateway Request Validation Not Enabled** <br> **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation**               | Runtime | **High**   | Without request validation at the API Gateway layer (e.g., validating request body, headers, or query strings), malformed or malicious input can reach downstream services. This increases the risk of prompt injection in LLMs, malformed requests crashing the orchestrator, or unexpected logic execution. |
| 8 | **Input Validation** | **API Gateway Content Encoding Not Enforced**<br>**CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests ('HTTP Request Smuggling')**<br>**CWE-116: Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output**<br>**CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')** | Runtime         | **Medium** | API Gateway does not enforce strict validation of incoming request `Content-Type` or `Content-Encoding` headers (e.g., accepting non-JSON or unvalidated gzip-compressed requests). This inconsistency in how encodings are handled between the API Gateway (intermediary) and backend Lambda functions can lead to **CWE-444**, where attackers exploit differences in HTTP message parsing to perform request smuggling. Additionally, malformed or deceptive payloads may bypass parser logic and inject content interpreted incorrectly downstream, reflecting **CWE-116** and **CWE-74**. This increases the risk of injection attacks, logic bypasses, or denial-of-service conditions through payload confusion or exploitation of parser inconsistencies. |
| 9 | **Caching / Security**            | **Stage-Level Cache Encryption Not Enabled** <br> **CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information** | Provision   | **Medium** | When stage-level caching is enabled in API Gateway, unencrypted responses may be stored in plaintext. This can expose sensitive data (e.g., session info, tokens, user context) in cache if accessed or dumped via misconfiguration or compromise.                            |
| 11 | **Key Management / Cert Hygiene** | **Certificate Rotation Not Enabled** <br> **CWE-298: Improper Validation of Certificate Expiration**          | Maintenance | **Medium** | TLS certificates for custom domains in API Gateway, if not rotated regularly, become long-lived secrets. If leaked, they could be exploited for spoofing, interception, or unauthorized access. This risk is amplified in multi-tenant environments or shared infrastructure. |
| 12     | **Routing & API Gateway Configuration**  | **Greedy Route Misconfiguration (Catch-All Routing with `{proxy+}` and `ANY`)**<br>**CWE-923: Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints**<br>**CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization** | **Runtime** | **High**     | Occurs when a greedy route like `/{proxy+}` with `ANY` method is configured in an API Gateway, causing it to **intercept and handle requests meant for more specific routes** (e.g., `/users`, `/products/{id}`). This leads to **incorrect routing**, unintentional behavior, or security flaws, especially if the backend (e.g., a Lambda function) isn't prepared to handle all route variations. <br><br>Also referred to as a **"catch-all" misconfiguration**, it results in valid routes being ignored or bypassed due to path matching priority. Backends must perform manual routing logic, which is error-prone and increases complexity. <br><br>**Examples:**<br> - `/users/123` expected to hit `/users/{id}`, but is caught by `/{proxy+}` instead.<br> - `ANY` method on greedy routes unintentionally handles GET/POST/PUT meant for more controlled paths.<br><br>**Impact:** Can lead to exposure of unintended endpoints, custom logic errors, mishandled parameters, or abuse of backend functions due to **overbroad route capture**.|                                                                                                                                                      | 13     | **Authentication / Session Management**  | **Token Replay / Reuse Accepted** <br> **CWE-294: Authentication Bypass by Capture-Replay** <br> **CWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration**                                                                                 | **Runtime** | **Critical** | Occurs when an API accepts **stolen or replayed JWT access tokens or refresh tokens** without binding them to a client or validating their reuse. Tokens may be obtained from browser localStorage, logs, or intercepted traffic. <br><br> Replay occurs because the token is still valid (e.g., long TTL, poor revocation strategy), and the backend **relies only on signature checks** without enforcing proper context validation (e.g., device binding, nonce, etc.). <br><br>**Impact:** Attackers can persistently impersonate a user across sessions or services, especially if refresh tokens are used to mint new access tokens, leading to **account takeover** and **horizontal movement**.|
| 14     | **Authorization / Policy Configuration** | **Overbroad Authorizer Configuration** <br> **CWE-285: Improper Authorization Definition** <br> **CWE-863: Incorrect Authorization**                                                                                          | **Runtime** | **High**     | Occurs when API Gateway authorizers are configured to accept **tokens from incorrect sources**, or grant broader access than intended. Common causes include **lack of issuer/audience/client ID pinning**, weak or missing scope checks, or improper use of **ID tokens instead of access tokens**. <br><br>Additionally, **authorizer cache TTL** may return outdated "allow" responses, and permissive fallback policies may unintentionally grant access. <br><br>**Example:** An access token issued for App A is accepted by App B's API, allowing attackers to cross application boundaries. <br><br>**Impact:** Enables **cross-application token abuse**, privilege escalation, or bypassing of least-privilege controls at the API edge.

These flaws can be exploited through insecure system calls or shell invocations within the application (e.g., os.system(), subprocess), potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands, escalate privileges inside the container, or crash the runtime environment.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

An internal or compromised actor can misuse these roles to overwrite trusted images in ECR, alter ECS task definitions, or inject malicious code into the app (e.g., XSS, command injection in Streamlit components). Exploitation occurs during the build phase, potentially compromising downstream deployments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Sensitive scripts or config files copied during image build may be accessible at runtime. If an attacker gains access to the container filesystem, they can read or modify these files, leading to potential privilege escalation or persistence. Misconfiguration occurs at build time; exploitation typically happens at runtime.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

If an attacker gains access to the container, root-level privileges allow high-impact actions such as accessing sensitive ENV variables, exfiltrating credentials from metadata endpoints, modifying runtime files, or installing persistence mechanisms. Exploitation can be carried out by internal or external actors during runtime.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Adversaries can reverse-engineer the image contents to discover sensitive logic, exposed environment variables (`.env`), hardcoded credentials, internal API endpoints, or even cloud resource identifiers like S3 buckets or database names. This increases the risk of targeted attacks, code exploitation, or data exfiltration based on internal knowledge gleaned from image analysis.If given policies with es\:ESHttpPut, es\:ESHttpDelete , can put and delete using ecs task                                                                                                               |

This increases the storage cost, clutters the image space with outdated or test builds, and makes it harder to monitor and secure the supply chain. Attackers may exploit this by uploading large or malicious images to exhaust storage limits or by hiding backdoors in old images that are no longer actively scanned or deployed but remain accessible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                          |

These are easily exposed through logs, `/proc/self/environ`, or Docker APIs, especially if the container runs as root. Secrets should be stored securely using AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

This bypasses perimeter protections like NAT gateways or internal ALBs, increasing the surface area for exploitation via exposed ports or known CVEs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 11 | **Ephemeral Storage Encryption / KMS Misconfiguration** | **CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data<br>- CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**<br>- Misconfiguration: Missing or incorrect Customer-Managed KMS (CMK) assignment / over-permissive or insufficient KMS key policy (e.g., failing to grant the Fargate service principal GenerateDataKey* permissions) | Deployment + Runtime | **High** | Fargate tasks use ephemeral storage (20 GiB by default on platform version 1.4.0+, configurable up to 200 GiB via ephemeralStorage). If ephemeral storage is not encrypted with a customer-managed KMS key (or a CMK is assigned but the key policy lacks the required Fargate service principal/grants), sensitive runtime artifacts (temporary files, caches, uploaded files, extracted secrets, swap/tmp data, credentials written to disk) can be stored in cleartext at rest ‚Äî increasing the risk of data exposure, failing compliance requirements, and enabling post-compromise data disclosure. Misconfigurations to watch for include: running tasks on platform versions or legacy tasks launched before default AES-256 encryption dates, not configuring the cluster‚Äôs managedStorageConfiguration.fargateEphemeralStorageKmsKeyId, or using overly-broad KMS key policies that grant unnecessary principals decrypt access (or conversely, missing grants that cause provisioning failures). 
| 12    | **ECS Exec Enabled in Production**              | **CWE-284: Improper Access Control**<br>**CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource** | Runtime         | **High**   | ECS Exec, when enabled in production, allows interactive command execution inside running containers over SSM. If the `ecs:EnableExecuteCommand` condition key is permitted without restriction, attackers with sufficient IAM permissions can gain shell-like access to containers, bypassing application-layer security. This can lead to direct retrieval of secrets from environment variables, modification of container files, or execution of arbitrary system commands. In compromised IAM scenarios, this effectively becomes a remote code execution (RCE) path into sensitive workloads.
| 13    | **Task Metadata Endpoint Exposure**             | **CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information**<br>**CWE-1230: Exposure of Sensitive Information Through Metadata**<br>**CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** | Runtime         | **High**   | If an attacker attains root in a container, they can query the ECS task metadata/credentials endpoint (e.g., `169.254.170.2` + `AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI`) to harvest short-lived AWS STS credentials for the task role and enumerate rich task/cluster context (launch type, container/task ARNs, log driver/options, AZ, network stats, ephemeral storage details, lifecycle timestamps). With these credentials, the attacker can invoke AWS APIs allowed by the task role‚Äîexfiltrate S3/Secrets Manager/SSM data, decrypt with KMS, modify ECS task/service definitions or ECR images, and, if permitted, pivot via `sts:AssumeRole`‚Äîescalating a container compromise into broader account impact and lateral movement. |
| 14 | **Outdated / Deprecated Fargate Platform Version** | **CWE-1104: Use of Unmaintained Third-Party Component**<br> | Runtime | **High** | Pinning tasks to older or deprecated Fargate platform versions (or vulnerable revisions) inherits unpatched kernel/container runtime issues and misses security feature updates. AWS patches by issuing new platform revisions and retires tasks on vulnerable revisions; deprecated platform versions stop receiving security fixes entirely. Exploitation impact includes leveraging known kernel/runtime CVEs for container escape or privilege escalation and increased data exposure where platform-level protections weren‚Äôt yet available (e.g., ephemeral task storage encryption was introduced in platform 1.4.0; tasks launched earlier lacked default at-rest encryption). Result: a compromised container can more readily break isolation, read/modify task data on disk, and pivot laterally using the task‚Äôs AWS credentials. 
| 15 | **Overprivileged Task Execution Role ‚Äì Private Registry Auth** | **CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource** | Runtime | **High** | Over-broad permissions to retrieve registry credentials (e.g., secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on *) or manage private registries enable credential exfiltration and image tampering. An attacker with container foothold and task execution role creds can pull/push to external registries (Docker Hub/Quay/custom), swap images, or poison dependencies‚Äîturning the supply chain into an RCE vector against the Streamlit/Fargate workload. |
| 16 | **Overprivileged Task Execution Role and Task Role ‚Äì Secrets Manager / SSM** | **CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource** | Runtime | **High** | Wildcard access to secretsmanager/ssm/kms (e.g., secretsmanager:GetSecretValue, ssm:GetParameter*, kms:Decrypt on *) lets an attacker dump DB creds, API tokens, and app keys or overwrite secrets to inject malicious config at next fetch. This turns a single container compromise into data exfiltration and persistent control across services used by the Fargate tasks. |
| 17 | **Overprivileged Task Execution Role ‚Äì ECR via VPC Endpoints** | **CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource**| Deployment | **High** | Granting ecr:* (e.g., PutImage, SetRepositoryPolicy, BatchDeleteImage) or overly-permissive VPC endpoint policies allows adversaries to replace or backdoor images pulled at task start. Compromised execution role credentials enable silent supply-chain swaps so new/rolling Fargate tasks run attacker-controlled code. |
| 18 | **Overprivileged Task Execution Role and Task Role ‚Äì Enable Container Insights Events** | **CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource**| Runtime | **Medium** | Granting broad CloudWatch Logs/Events permissions (e.g., logs:PutRetentionPolicy, logs:DeleteLogGroup, events:Put*,cloudwatch:*) enables log tampering or suppression. An attacker can disable retention, delete or divert logs, and reduce telemetry, degrading detection/forensics for the ECS/Streamlit services. 
|19 | **Overprivileged Task Role ‚Äì IAM / STS Privilege Escalation (AssumeRole / PassRole / IAM Full)** | **CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**| Runtime | **High** | Granting the task role sts:AssumeRole, iam:PassRole, iam:CreateRole, iam:AttachRolePolicy or similarly broad IAM permissions enables an attacker to escalate to higher-privilege roles or create service principals. Exploit chain: compromise container ‚Üí obtain task creds via metadata ‚Üí assume an admin role or create/attach policies to a new role ‚Üí obtain persistent credentials or run privileged services. This is a direct path from container compromise to full account compromise. |
| 20 | **Overprivileged Task Role ‚Äì ECS / Orchestration Control (RunTask / UpdateService / RegisterTaskDefinition)** | **CWE-250: Execution with Unnecessary Privileges**| Deployment / Runtime | **High** | If the task role can call ecs:RunTask, ecs:UpdateService, ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition ‚Äî especially combined with iam:PassRole ‚Äî an attacker can launch new tasks with arbitrary images, substitute task definitions, or update services to run privileged workloads (different subnets, task roles, or platform versions). Exploit path: container compromise ‚Üí use task creds to register/run a backdoor task or replace running services, enabling persistence, lateral movement, and control over the service deployment lifecycle.
| 21 | **Unrestricted Request / Resource Exhaustion (Outdated HTTP Library)** | **CWE-770: Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling**| Image + Runtime | **High** | An outdated HTTP library bundled in the container fails to enforce request size or parsing limits. An attacker can send extremely large payloads (example: expected ‚â§1MB, attacker sends ~80GB) or many concurrent oversized requests. The vulnerable library will allocate/stream the data into memory, CPU, network, and ephemeral storage without bounds‚Äîsaturating the container, triggering task restarts or autoscaling, exhausting ephemeral disk, and causing the service to throttle legitimate traffic (application-level DoS). On Fargate this also translates directly into significant cost impact (increased vCPU/memory runtime charges, data transfer/egress, and storage usage) because additional tasks or longer runtimes are billed. The root cause sits in the image (old library) but is exploited at runtime via malformed/oversized HTTP requests, making every deployment with that image susceptible until the library is updated.

## üõ°Ô∏è Stage 6 : Attack Modeling


This document covers **Step 6: Attack Modeling** from the [PASTA](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling) (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) methodology. This step builds on insights from earlier stages to **simulate real-world attack scenarios**, helping identify how threats can materialize into actual exploits against critical assets.

---

### üéØ Step 6: Purpose of Attack Modeling

The goal of this stage is to simulate **how an attacker could exploit identified vulnerabilities** and interact with the system to compromise assets. This is done by logically modeling attack steps, mapping vectors, and identifying exploit paths.

Attack modeling provides the **"attacker's perspective"**, turning earlier data into actionable security insights and testing artifacts.

### üî∂ Step 6.1 ‚Äì Identify the Application Attack Surface

This step focuses on identifying and documenting the **application attack surface** ‚Äî all the points where an attacker may interact with the system, directly or indirectly. Understanding the attack surface is crucial for determining **where threats can manifest**, and which assets or entry points may be exploited in later stages of an attack.

#### üß≠ Purpose

The goal is to:

- Map **entry and interaction points** across the application
- Define what‚Äôs **exposed**, to whom, and under what conditions
- Highlight areas where **untrusted input** enters the system
- Establish **trust boundaries** between services and users
- Identify **control gaps** or over-permissioned components

| **API Gateway**           | Internal API endpoint (ECS ‚Üí Lambda)           | **Internal only**          | May be abused from inside VPC; risks include token replay or request fuzzing       |
| **Lambda (Orchestrator)** | Coordinates input flow ‚Üí DynamoDB, OpenSearch, Bedrock | **Internal services**    | High-value target; over-permissioned IAM role could enable lateral movement        |
| **S3 (Document Bucket)**  | Stores user-uploaded PDFs                      | **Internal via Lambda**    | Poisoned files could affect downstream ML/LLM processing via embedded payloads     |
| **OpenSearch**            | Vector query API via SDK                       | **Lambda only**            | Vulnerable to index poisoning or vector tampering if ACLs fail                     |
| **Bedrock (Claude 3)**    | Generative AI model API for prompt response    | **Lambda only**            | Prompt injection could manipulate LLM behavior or exfiltrate data                  |
| **DynamoDB**              | Stores chat/session state                      | **Lambda only**            | Poor session isolation or token re-use could lead to unauthorized access           |
| **IAM Roles / STS**       | Lambda role with broad service permissions     | **AWS IAM trust policies** | Misconfigured trust relationships can lead to privilege escalation or role abuse   |
| **CloudWatch / Logging**  | Logging visibility (metrics, traces, logs)     | **Admin-only**             | Lack of granular logging may create visibility blind spots for threat detection    |

#### üîê Trust Boundaries and Exposure Types

The system consists of multiple **trust boundaries** that determine exposure:

- **External boundary**: Between untrusted users and ECS (UI)
- **Internal API boundary**: ECS ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Lambda
- **Service interaction boundary**: Lambda‚Äôs communication with AWS services (Bedrock, OpenSearch, DynamoDB)
- **Cloud infrastructure boundary**: IAM roles, STS trust, and monitoring controls

### üî∂ Step 6.2 ‚Äì Derive Attack Trees for Threats and Assets

We build **attack trees** to model attacker strategies and logic. Each tree includes:

- **Attacker goals** (e.g., privilege escalation, data theft)
- **Sequence of actions** that could lead to successful compromise

### üî∂ Step 6.3 ‚Äì Map Attack Vectors to Attack Tree Nodes

Each node in the attack tree is enriched with **real-world attack vectors**, such as:

- üß∞ **Credential Abuse** (e.g., token replay, hardcoded secrets)  
- üß∞ **Injection Techniques** (e.g., prompt injection, payload manipulation)  
- üß∞ **Infrastructure Attacks** (e.g., OpenSearch poisoning, SSRF)  
- üß∞ **Cloud Misconfigurations** (e.g., over-permissioned roles)  
- üß∞ **API Abuse** (e.g., rate bypass, schema fuzzing)  

Sources like **MITRE ATT&CK** and **MITRE Cloud Matrix**  are referenced to ensure relevance.

### üî∂ Step 6.4 ‚Äì Identify Exploits and Attack Paths

Finally, we identify **complete exploit chains** and how they traverse the system, including:

- Entry ‚Üí Lateral Movement ‚Üí Privilege Escalation ‚Üí Impact  
- Chain of events mapped from **initial vector** to **final asset compromise**
- Multiple attacker paths per scenario, including alternate or fallback methods

These paths become the basis for:

- Penetration Testing playbooks  
- Risk scoring (Likelihood √ó Impact)  
- Control design and mitigation planning
