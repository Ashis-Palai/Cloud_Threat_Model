# 🛡️ Threat Modeling with PASTA: AWS Bedrock RAG Chatbot

This document presents a comprehensive **PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)** threat modeling analysis for a cloud-native **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** architecture using **AWS Bedrock, ECS Fargate, Streamlit, DynamoDB, OpenSearch, Titan Embeddings, and Amazon S3**.

The objective is to assess threats systematically using the 7-stage PASTA methodology, allowing us to:
- Align technical and business impact in threat identification,
- Integrate architectural understanding (e.g., LLM workflows, user identity, document enrichment),
- Map simulated attack surfaces to controls across CSP-native services (e.g., IAM, Bedrock, VPC, Gateway, etc.).

PASTA enables not just vulnerability identification, but a **risk-oriented narrative** rooted in real-world attacker perspectives and **cloud-specific TTPs**. It’s especially valuable for systems like this where:
- Sensitive data flows between user input, documents, embeddings, and AI inference.
- There are complex multi-boundary interactions (VPC ↔ AWS-managed services).
- Orchestrators (Lambda) hold central control logic that needs careful review.

Each of the upcoming sections will dive into a stage of the PASTA model with relevance to our architecture.

## 🔍 PASTA Stage 1: Define the Objectives

This stage defines the **business**, **security**, and **risk** foundation for the RAG chatbot system.

### 1. Business Objectives

The primary goal of this application is to provide an interactive **LLM-powered chatbot** that allows users to query across structured and unstructured enterprise knowledge using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** framework.  
The system leverages:
- **AWS Bedrock (Claude 3)** for LLM inference,
- **Titan Embeddings + OpenSearch** for semantic search,
- **Amazon S3** as the document source, and
- **DynamoDB** for session memory/state.

Key functional outcomes:
- Deliver fast, context-aware chatbot responses.
- Seamlessly incorporate new document knowledge without retraining.
- Enable enterprise-wide secure access to AI-powered search/assist features.

### 2. Security and Compliance Requirements

Given the nature of document ingestion and LLM interaction, the system must ensure:
- **Data confidentiality** of user input and chat history (via encryption at rest and in transit),
- **IAM-based least privilege** access across Lambda, Bedrock, and storage layers,
- **Protection against prompt injection and session hijacking**,
- **Audit trails** for all sensitive operations (e.g., document embedding, LLM invocation),
- **Regulatory readiness**: GDPR/ISO 27001-style access control and retention policies,
- Compliance with **Cloud Security Alliance (CSA CCM)**, **NIST CSF**, and **AWS Well-Architected Framework** security pillars.

### 3. Business Impact (BIA)

If the system is compromised or unavailable:
- **Data integrity loss** in embeddings or RAG sources may degrade response quality.
- **LLM spoofing or leakage** may cause reputational or compliance damage.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)** on document ingestion pipeline (S3 → Titan → Vector DB) may render chatbot non-functional.
- Impaired or manipulated chatbot responses can lead to **loss of user trust**, especially if misinformation or unauthorized access occurs.

Impact severity: **High**, especially for document-sensitive organizations (e.g., legal, healthcare, or internal ops).

### 4. Risk Profile

The system operates under a **moderate-to-high threat surface**, including:
- External user interactions,
- API gateway exposures,
- LLM model behavior unpredictability,
- Vector DB poisoning or enumeration,
- Weak isolation in serverless contexts.

Mitigation posture includes:
- Tight IAM policies,
- Use of AWS-native threat detection (GuardDuty, CloudTrail),
- Data validation and schema enforcement before embedding,
- Embedding fingerprinting or duplicate detection.

This risk profile sets the tone for deeper analysis in the next stages of the PASTA process.

## 🧭 PASTA Stage 2: Define the Technical Scope

This stage identifies the architectural boundaries, actors, data sources/sinks, and all technical dependencies of the RAG-based chatbot system.

### 2.0 Technical Scope Overview

The RAG chatbot is a distributed, cloud-native application deployed across customer-controlled and AWS-managed services. It integrates serverless orchestration, real-time embeddings, and LLM inference across multiple trust zones.

---

### 2.1 Identify Application Boundaries, Actors, Data Sources & Sinks

**Trust Boundaries:**
- **Internet**: Entry point for users accessing the chatbot via Streamlit.
- **AWS Customer VPC**: Hosts ECS, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3.
- **AWS Managed Services**: Includes Bedrock (Claude 3), OpenSearch, and Titan Embeddings.

**Actors:**
- External: End-users interacting via UI.
- Internal: Lambda (orchestrator), Titan (embedding engine), Bedrock (LLM inference).

**Data Sources:**
- User inputs (chat queries),
- S3 documents (knowledge ingestion),
- DynamoDB (chat memory).

**Data Sinks:**
- OpenSearch (embedding vector storage),
- Bedrock (consumes RAG-enriched prompts),
- Streamlit UI (delivers final response).

---

### 2.2 Application Dependencies from Network Environment

- **API Gateway** acts as the control plane for routing requests to Lambda.
- **VPC endpoints / PrivateLink** are recommended for internal communication with AWS managed services to avoid traffic over the public internet.
- **TLS/HTTPS** is enforced for all inter-service communication.
- Network access is segmented by security groups and NACLs to reduce lateral movement.

---

### 2.3 Application Dependencies from Servers & Infrastructure

- **ECS Fargate**: Stateless container runtime that handles incoming UI traffic, performs pre-processing, and relays requests to the Lambda orchestrator.
- **Lambda**: Central orchestrator managing session state, context fetching, embedding pipelines, and LLM interactions.
- **DynamoDB**: Provides chat session persistence across user interactions.
- **Amazon S3**: Stores static documents to be processed and embedded for semantic context.
- **Amazon OpenSearch (Vector DB)**: Stores embeddings with metadata, enabling semantic search retrieval based on Titan vector matches.
- **AWS Bedrock (Claude 3)**: Executes LLM prompts and returns chat-like responses in context.

All services are deployed through **Infrastructure as Code** using tools like **AWS CDK** or **Terraform**, enabling repeatable, policy-compliant provisioning.

---

### 2.4 Application Dependencies from Software Components

- **Streamlit (Python)**: UI layer where users input queries and receive final responses.
- **FastAPI / Flask**: Lightweight backend server deployed on ECS for routing, validation, and session token handling.
- **LangChain or custom prompt orchestration**: Manages chaining logic for RAG — embedding → search → prompt creation → LLM call.
- **SentenceTransformers or Titan Integration Layer**: Used to convert documents or user queries into embeddings before storing in OpenSearch.
- **OpenSearch Python Client**: Enables querying the vector DB from Lambda using vector similarity.
- **Requests / HTTPX**: For making HTTPS calls from Lambda or ECS to Bedrock, Titan, or internal services.
- **JSON Schema Validators**: Used to validate the structure of prompt templates, documents, and embeddings to prevent malformed data or injection attacks.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline to automate deployment of Lambda, ECS tasks, and IaC modules. Static analysis, policy scans, and OPA gatekeeping may be included.

This completes the technical scope definition for the system. Next, we move into identifying threat agents and potential attack vectors in Stage 3.

## 🧩 PASTA Stage 3: Decompose the Application

This stage focuses on breaking down the RAG chatbot application into use cases, data flows, and security-functional boundaries to enable detailed threat enumeration in later stages.

---

### 3.1 Use Case Enumeration

The primary use cases for the AWS Bedrock RAG chatbot include:

- **Chat Interaction**: Users input natural language questions via the Streamlit UI.
- **Query Handling**: ECS backend forwards input to the Lambda orchestrator.
- **Context Enrichment**:
  - Lambda fetches session history from DynamoDB.
  - It queries OpenSearch for relevant embedded content.
  - If required, it generates embeddings via Titan from documents stored in S3.
- **Prompt Construction & LLM Execution**: Enriched prompt is sent to Claude 3 via AWS Bedrock; response returned.
- **Response Delivery**: Lambda updates session history and sends final output to Streamlit via ECS.

### 3.3 Security Functional Analysis and Trust Boundaries

**Defined Trust Boundaries:**

- **Internet Boundary**: Initial untrusted zone where users initiate interaction.
- **Customer VPC Boundary**: Secure zone where ECS, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3 (private) operate under strict IAM controls.
- **AWS Managed Services Boundary**: Operated by AWS; includes Bedrock, Titan Embeddings, and OpenSearch (vector DB).

**Security Functional Observations:**

- Lambda operates across multiple trust boundaries and holds central access to sensitive systems. It requires strict runtime integrity, IAM role separation, and telemetry.
- Data entering the system passes through multiple stages: ECS > API Gateway > Lambda > vector enrichment > LLM. Each stage is a potential threat insertion point if not validated or encrypted.
- Documents stored in S3 act as upstream knowledge sources and must be immutable and verified before embedding.
- Embedding and search infrastructure (Titan + OpenSearch) is AWS-managed but interacts bidirectionally with Lambda, requiring encryption in-transit, fine-grained policy control, and embedding tamper detection.
- All ingress and egress paths are TLS-enforced. Logging and audit trails must span across boundaries to support full forensic visibility.
